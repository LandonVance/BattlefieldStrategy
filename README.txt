  This project is part of the acedemic curriculum for the Saint Louis University Computer Science Department.  This repository will be updated as the project developes so that involved parties may monitor progress.

-----ON SOURCES-----
  As of 1/28/13 the repo contains a text file named "Sources.txt".  This is a running list of sources that I have used thus far in my project.  This file is NOT intended to indicate any formal declaration of sources.  Such a formal declaration will not occur until an actualy product is realeased (alpha or pre alpha).  Until then this list exists only to assist me in keeping track of sources I've looked at.
