Capstone Project

  This project is part of the acedemic curriculum for the Saint Louis University Computer Science Department.  This repository will be updated as the project developes so that involved parties may monitor progress.

-----ON SOURCES-----
  As of 1/28/13 the repo contains a text file named "Sources.txt".  This is a running list of sources that I have used thus far in my project.  This file is NOT intended to indicate any formal declaration of sources.  Such a formal declaration will not occur until an actualy product is realeased (alpha).  Until then this list exists only to assist me in keeping track of sources I've looked at.

-----ON CONTRACT-----
  As of 1/28/13 the repo includes a copy of the contract (readable in libreoffice) for the project.  This copy is NOT intended to be official in any way shape or form, signatures have been removed to indicate this.  This copy is will be used to monitor progress.

-----ON CLASS DIAGRAM-----
  As of 1/30/13 the repo contains a class diagram file "UML-Class.class.voilet" viewable in voilet UML maker.  This diagram is a work in progress.  It's also worth noting that inheritance in GameMaker seems like it may very well function differently than inheritance in Java and C++, so further changes may be necessary down the line (as I become more acquainted with the game engine's functionality).

-----ON PRE-ALPHA SOURCE-----
  As of 2/2/13 developement source has been added to a repo folder named "Pre-Alpha Source".  Any source in this folder is in the early developement stage, and thus experimental in nature.  Build numbers are allocated as follows: month-day-year-hour-minute (with no hyphens) with each field holding two digits.  For example, source uploaded at 2:30 am Febuary 2 2013 would have the build number 0202130230.
